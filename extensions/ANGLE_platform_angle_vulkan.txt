Additions to the EGL Specification

    None.

New Behavior

    To request a display that is backed by a Vulken driver, the value of
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_TYPE_ANGLE should be
    EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_TYPE_VULKAN_ANGLE.

    If EGL_PLATFORM_ANGLE_ENABLE_VALIDATION_LAYER_ANGLE is specified, it
    controls enabling the standard Vulkan validation layers. EGL_TRUE enables
    the validation and EGL_FALSE disables it. Any value other than these will
    result in an error. Initially, validation may default to either enabled
    or disabled, depending on compile-time parameters in the implementation.

Issues

    1) Would it be better to specify validation layers individually?

       RESOLVED: It would give more fined grained control, but the layers
       are sensitive to ordering, and there may be new ones added or old ones
       removed, this abstracts the logic into a simpler form.
